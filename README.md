# Spatial-Audio-Using-ARKit-HeadRotation

1. Use Unreal Engines "Live Link Face" to capture the headrotation
2. Place audio sources in the scene
3. Voila - Spatial audio without VR!

One great application would be a voice/videoconference app that allows placing the participants in 3D space to reduce "cocktail-effect" 

This is possible right now with Unreals AR example in the Learn tab.
